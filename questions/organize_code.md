# How can I organize my code?

There is not a standard, but we can check how the people normally do.

If you check the examples on [Facebook React Native Examples](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/tree/master/Examples),
you will figure out that there is no a standard. Although this, we can divide in folders, such as:

```
-- App
  --- Components
  --- Helpers
  --- Utils
-- iOS
-- Android
-- index.ios.js
-- index.android.js
```

This idea was taken from [Egghead Course](https://github.com/eggheadio/react-native-gh-notetaker)
